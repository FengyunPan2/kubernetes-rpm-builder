Build kubernetes rpm binaries
-------------
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mritd/kubernetes-rpm-builder
# you must install golang 1.6+ manually; no RPM currently available
sudo yum install rpm-build etcd
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
# make sure you have ample storage space available, both here and in /tm; 5GB is not enough
cd kubernetes-rpm-builder
./build_latest_stable_kubernetes.sh v1.3.3    # argument is the git tag to build
```
